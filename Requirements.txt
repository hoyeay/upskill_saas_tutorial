Stripe Integration
* Users should have a stripe customer token in the users table
* Javascript should prevent Pro form from submitting, when user fills it out
    and should send card info to Stripe. Stripe will return a card token.
* Javascript should send user fields and card tokens to our rails app.
    Rails app should validate the user fields. Rails will note whether plan 1 or 2.
* Once validated, Rails should send user info (email, plan id) and card token
    to Stripe server and Stripe will create subscription and send back customer token.
    Now we can save customer to Rails app.
